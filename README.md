# HumanParsing-Dataset

This human parsing dataset includes the detailed pixel-wise annotations for fashion images, which is proposed in our TPAMI paper 
"Deep Human Parsing with Active Template Regression", and ICCV 2015 paper "Human Parsing with Contextualized Convolutional Neural Network".
Please cite our two papers if you use this dataset for  acadamic and commercial research.
